# Historical reproduction

Full pre-restructure checkpoint: [archive/2026_09_09_10_30_34_before_unified_layout](https://github.com/souray0410/Radon_Bridge/tree/archive/2026_09_09_10_30_34_before_unified_layout), Git commit `d5b55854ea9ec09661127db6780d818f1ff98460`. Check out this branch in a separate directory and use its recorded dependencies and source/data manifests to reproduce historical experiments. Its reports/configuration/acceptance records retain original bytes.

Current scientific raw/checkpoint storage remains where recorded; moving code in the new branch does not delete or rewrite those artifacts. Old Python object serialization may require the old import paths/environment. New work must not silently treat old test data as a fresh tuning set.
